# Environmental-Color-Scheme
[Developing a Process and Toolkits for the Sampling and Visualization of Environmental Color Scheme]

This research proposes a new process and a toolkit to pick colors and mash up with Google Maps to build the foundation of the environmental color and Dynamic Color Scheme to become a platform of interoperable open data. If a large amount of environmental schemes are accumulated, this system can be used for National Land Use Monitoring Program.This research simplifies the process of color sampling,
color picking then analyzes photos by toolkits creating Environmental 

Color Scheme (ECS). ECS is a type of Dynamic Color Scheme (DCS) and Personalized Color Scheme (PCS). DCS is dynamically redefined depending on certain contexts, e.g. location and mood, and PCS is used in fashion, personal preferences and so on. In practice, PCS & DCS exist already, for example in landscape design, and this research tries to extend their diversity to knowledge sharing, collective contributions and crowd intelligence.

This thesis builds a workflow of color picking and color scheme, that consist of obtaining environmental samples, toolkit, image processing and visualization. Moreover, the process links several software and platforms, including Photoshop and Google Maps by scripting, so that users can easily and effectively collect valid and substantial environmental color samples. In addition, the color analysis of environment is going to help us on design or planning orders to reach the basic situation of the surrounding.
